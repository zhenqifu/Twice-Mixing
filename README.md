## Introduction
In this project, we use Ubuntu 16.04.5, Python 3.7, Pytorch 1.7.1 and one NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti GPU. 

## Running

### Testing

Download the pretrained model [pre-trained model](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ClGBtwXZzGrcLiwGf-IdfA (qacp))(qacp).

Check the model and image pathes in test.py, and then run:

```
python test.py
```

### Training

To train the model, you need to first prepare our [dataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10pSRRu9OyeaVh2ZlSh4BlA (lstd))(lstd). 

Check the dataset path in train.py, and then run:
```
python train.py
```
